An award-winning history professor from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, revolutionizes how you view the world as he introduces you to some of the greatest and most influential explorers ever known-successful as well as unsuccessful, admirable as well as flawed. You'll be spellbound as you learn of the treacherous, at times fatal, expeditions into the unknown these adventurers embarked upon, whether to the frozen Poles, Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, the ocean's depths, or the final frontier of space. </p> <p>Through it all, you consider what drove these intrepid individuals, from proselytizing and pilgrimage to the lure of wealth, conquest, fame, and new lands, as evidenced by the Vikings' arrival in North America; Marco Polo's journey along the Silk Road to China; Christopher Columbus' \"Enterprise of the Indies\"; the conquistadors' ravages in Latin America; and the tiny kingdom of Portugal's triumphant circumnavigation of Africa to seize control of trade in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>In every lesson, you'll follow these fascinating figures - including several remarkable women - as they venture into uncharted territory and put themselves, and often their crews, in dire peril. With Professor Liulevicius' uniquely global approach, you also get a meaningful portrait of the travels of non-Westerners, as well as the perspectives of discovered people.</p>","releaseDate":"2015-01-12","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"World","url":"18573695011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000397/bk_tcco_000397_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"518giXhe+mL","asin":"B00DJB03JK","title":"Turning Points in Modern History","authors":"Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius, The Great Courses","narrators":"Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius","length":"12 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"41n+xIEkb1L","asin":"B00DL6HROW","title":"The World Was Never the Same: Events That Changed History","authors":"J.

Professor Hans-Friedrich Mueller, of Union College in Schenectady, New York, makes this ancient world come alive in 24 lectures with captivating stories of intrigue, artifacts, illustrations, and detailed descriptions from primary sources of intriguing personalities.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the ancient Mediterranean area, religion was not separate from daily life. To the contrary, religion was daily life. The many dozen gods of this ancient world were everywhere, with spirits inhabiting every crack and crevice of life. These polytheists believed they had a strict contract with their deities: If they took care of their gods, their gods would take care of them (or at least not harm them). Consequently, they built extraordinary temples to honor their deities, brought food and wine to them, sacrificed animals for them, and held sacred meals with their gods. In fact, they followed numerous rules and regulations that circumscribed almost all aspects of life both inside and outside the home - anything and everything to keep the gods happy. Consequently, the religious practices of the ancient Mediterranean make a wonderful lens through which to develop a deeper understanding of their world.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-02-28","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001174/bk_tcco_001174_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51IT1YExLvL","asin":"B07BHXDXW9","title":"The Celtic World","authors":"The Great Courses","narrators":"Professor Jennifer Paxton PhD","length":"12 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51vWmWn7-5L","asin":"B07C3B6MNN","subHeading":"Life in the Cradle of Civilization","title":"Ancient Mesopotamia","authors":"The Great Courses","narrators":"Professor Amanda H.

Arguments can be divided into three parts: a claim, evidence, and an inference linking the evidence to the claim. All arguments fall into a handful of distinctive categories, and the same issues are at stake each time one of these distinctive patterns occurs. Three kinds of evidence can be advanced to prove an argument that something is true: objective data, social consensus, and personal credibility. There are six kinds of inference that link evidence to a claim: example, cause, sign, analogy, narrative, and form. How to use and challenge each is explained. </p> <p>Along the way, you'll look at numerous actual controversies with a perspective that allows you to see the structure of all disputes. In this way, argument becomes an exchange, not just a flurry of words.</p>","releaseDate":"2013-07-08","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","url":"18574784011"},{"name":"Personal Development","url":"18574800011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000034/bk_tcco_000034_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41wEj7lRIFL","asin":"B0096TP6F0","title":"The Five Elements of Effective Thinking","authors":"Edward B.

Now, in this revised edition, Jay M. Feinman offers an updated survey of American law, spiced with new anecdotes and cases, and incorporating fresh material on topics ranging from the President's war powers, to intellectual property, standard form contracts, and eminent domain. Here is an exceptionally clear introduction to law, covering the main subjects found in the first year of law school, giving us a basic understanding of how it all works. Listeners are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in Marbury v. Madison that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the listener's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" in constitutional law, to the distinction between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that though the law is voluminous and complex, it is accessible to all. Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues - from students contemplating law school, to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, to fans of Court TV - will find here a wonderful source of information: A complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system. </p>","releaseDate":"2013-12-17","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"18574641011"},{"name":"Politics & Government","url":"18574665011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/014033/bk_adbl_014033_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51ERdD8SEnL","asin":"B00JLJHEHS","title":"Exploring Metaphysics","authors":"David K.

An American renegade and fearless truth teller. Rage Against the Machine’s guitar virtuoso, Tom Morello, is many things, but perhaps he himself sums it up best: <i>a one man revolution.</i> For the first time ever, hear Morello fuse the deeply personal with the political in a rapturous, badass, one-man show that skillfully balances soul-bearing stories with spellbinding guitar fury. This is <i>Tom Morello at Minetta Lane Theatre: Speaking Truth to Power Through Stories and Song.</i></p> <p>Executive produced by the legendary, multi-Grammy winning producer and composer T Bone Burnett, Morello’s performance adds to a growing list of iconic talent (Patti Smith, James Taylor, Common) who give voice to Audible’s Words and Music series: a new type of audio-only memoir that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.</p> <p>Morello begins at the beginning, opening up about his tumultuous childhood in small-town Illinois, his grappling with sense of identity and ultimate artistic purpose. <i>\"I was the only black kid in an all-white town, the only anarchist at a conservative high school, the only heavy metal shredding guitar player at Harvard University, and the only Ivy League Star Trek loving nerd in the world’s biggest political rock rap band.”</i> As Morello takes us thru poignant moments of an astounding and meaningful career (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, the Nightwatchman, Springsteen and the E-Street Band, Prophets of Rage, <i>The Atlas Underground</i>) we hear firsthand of the triumphs and tragedies, riffs and rebellions that mark a life in shattering artistic bounds, confronting the establishment, and creating/collaborating on music that matters<i>.</i></p> <p>By the time Tom closes out the show by leading a palpably super-charged audience through a banging version of “Killing in the Name Of”, Lennon’s working-class anthem “Power to the People”, and, finally, a spirited and wholly sincere “This Land Is Your Land”, a piercing truth resounds: Tom Morello is a singular force and a most <i>essential</i> type of artist: the kind who not only inspires but empowers. In the words of T Bone Burnett, who provides a tender lead-in to the rare performance, <i>“There is no more articulate or intelligent musician today than Tom Morello. He is a magical guitarist and a deep storyteller whose life and artistry reflect and challenge the time we live in.”</i>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-08-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Audio Performances & Dramatizations","url":"18571919011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000737/or_orig_000737_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51BGPJCkfsL","asin":"B08G1Z4ZJF","title":"St. Vincent: Words + Music","authors":"St. Vincent","narrators":"St. Vincent","length":"1 hr and 29 mins"},{"cover":"512bSM2nZYL","asin":"B08WWKQFC4","title":"Upon Reflection","authors":"Sting","narrators":"Sting","length":"1 hr and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51AY3hc8xqL","asin":"B08HNJ2CZG","title":"Sheryl Crow: Words + Music","authors":"Sheryl Crow","narrators":"Sheryl Crow","length":"1 hr and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51Qs2dPG6XL","asin":"1735803200","title":"Fauci","authors":"Michael Specter","narrators":"Michael Specter","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"51nLtYnJhOL","asin":"B08WCCDJD2","subHeading":"A Newark Family Memoir","title":"Force of Beauty","authors":"Mikki Taylor, Deborah Riley Draper","narrators":"Mikki Taylor","length":"2 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51PsnheQZ6L","asin":"B08KWNTR1M","title":"Alanis Morissette: Words + Music","authors":"Alanis Morissette","narrators":"Alanis Morissette","length":"1 hr and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51tjmlEs9vL","asin":"B08JNLF1J7","title":"The Confederacy: Truth and Reconciliation","authors":"T Bone Burnett","narrators":"T Bone Burnett","length":"1 hr and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51AsUIfn4xL","asin":"B08BTYG121","title":"Yard Work","authors":"David Koepp","narrators":"Kevin Bacon","length":"1 hr and 54 mins"},{"cover":"51zqcy6fKDL","asin":"B08NC8JQ1S","title":"Smokey Robinson: Grateful and Blessed","authors":"Smokey Robinson","narrators":"Smokey Robinson","length":"1 hr and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51fZaMdDgjL","asin":"B08WF112B9","subHeading":"Honest Conversation on Race in America","title":"We've Got Answers","authors":"Charlamagne Tha God","narrators":"Charlamagne Tha God, James Altucher, special guests","length":"12 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51WgeJfzbWL","asin":"B08NWBDKD3","title":"A Streetcar Named Desire","authors":"Tennessee Williams","narrators":"Carla Gugino, Audra McDonald","length":"2 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51lctAfvrcL","asin":"B08C36PKWN","title":"Half Light","authors":"Tayari Jones","narrators":"Bahni Turpin","length":"1 hr and 20 mins"},{"cover":"513y43PKExL","asin":"B08NWBF1Z3","subHeading":"My Life with Beethoven","title":"Unquiet","authors":"Jonathan Biss","narrators":"Jonathan Biss","length":"1 hr and 46 mins"},{"cover":"511f7tM-73L","asin":"B08W8R55YQ","title":"hop thA A","authors":"James Anthony Tyler","narrators":"Ronald Emile, Jayme Lawson, Kareem Lucas, and others","length":"1 hr and 27 mins"},{"cover":"51WV-3F8XiL","asin":"B08M93Q9SP","subHeading":"Montreal to New York","title":"Road Trip Elegies","authors":"Rufus Wainwright","narrators":"Rufus Wainwright","length":"3 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51F7gNVMUPL","asin":"B08YB4KQM1","title":"The Sound Inside","authors":"Adam Rapp","narrators":"Mary-Louise Parker, Will Hochman","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51SteOEMD8L","asin":"B08C6YJ1LS","title":"The Coldest Case: A Black Book Audio Drama","authors":"James Patterson, Aaron Tracy, Ryan Silbert","narrators":"Aaron Paul, Krysten Ritter, Nathalie Emmanuel, and others","length":"3 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51Y3javZLQL","asin":"B086XJ4CK7","title":"The Gentleman from Peru","authors":"Andre Aciman","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"2 hrs and 39 mins"}],"added":269},{"asin":"B0883GQZKV","cover":"51yNhpGvosL","title":"The Dragon Squisher","authors":[{"name":"Scott McCormick","url":"B00GRLRJ9Q"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Adam Fuller"}],"series":[{"name":"Nigel Chronicles","asin":"B08D4QJMQD","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"blurb":"“Before I can begin my tale, you need to know about the king's panties.” So begins the epic adventure of 14-year-old Nigel, digger of latrines, shoveler of poop, and the single greatest threat to all the humans, elves, and halflings of Esteria....","fromPlusCatalog":true,"unavailable":true,"length":"9h 19m","progress":0,"titleShort":"The Dragon Squisher","ratings":1142,"rating":4.5,"summary":"<p>“Before I can begin my tale, you need to know about the king's panties.”&nbsp;</p> <p>So begins the epic adventure of 14-year-old Nigel, digger of latrines, shoveler of poop, and the single greatest threat to all the humans, elves, and halflings of Esteria.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nigel needs to escape from military school.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p> <p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p> <p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point. </p> <p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-09-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/029631/bk_adbl_029631_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","asin":"B01FN88BHC","title":"Anna Karenina","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51vyUoMpjkL","asin":"B076DJLFRF","title":"Murder in an English Village","authors":"Jessica Ellicott","narrators":"Barbara Rosenblat","length":"9 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"517qEjjMXyL","asin":"B0040J17CW","title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Elijah Wood","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61j+AB3GUoL","asin":"B06X9MXN32","title":"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","narrators":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51Wl2hPRt5L","asin":"B00FFHJXSI","title":"The Things They Carried","authors":"Tim O'Brien","narrators":"Bryan Cranston","length":"7 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51Sc+GQHn-L","asin":"B00D94TX02","title":"1066: The Year That Changed Everything","authors":"Jennifer Paxton, The Great Courses","narrators":"Jennifer Paxton","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"51eo26hWHLL","asin":"B005QPB3X2","subHeading":"How the World Became Modern","title":"The Swerve","authors":"Stephen Greenblatt","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51y-ivhKErL","asin":"B016LN23CC","title":"Pride and Prejudice","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"612oBD9OSjL","asin":"B002V19RO6","subHeading":"New Classic Edition","title":"1984","authors":"George Orwell","narrators":"Simon Prebble","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"516MN+bKViL","asin":"0593396960","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Ready Player Two","authors":"Ernest Cline","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"13 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"5127OtHzHuL","asin":"B00FQRCM9O","title":"Frankenstein","authors":"Mary Shelley","narrators":"Dan Stevens","length":"8 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"5168DSbCuuL","asin":"2291064495","title":"The Iliad","authors":"Homer","narrators":"Charles Purkey","length":"14 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51WstlmPV6L","asin":"B00K0S7MQW","title":"The Age of Faith, Volume 4","authors":"Will Durant","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","length":"61 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"51AyV7rsScL","asin":"B015ELUYL4","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five","authors":"Kurt Vonnegut","narrators":"James Franco","length":"5 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"41BWRuWrVoL","asin":"B00E8JMNUO","title":"Don Quixote","authors":"Miguel de Cervantes, Gerald J.

This is <i>Bluebird Memories</i>, part of Audible's Words + Music that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.</p> <p>Written and conceived by Common with Awoye Timpo and NSangou Njikam, originally recorded live at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, and backed by a world-class band including special guest appearance by Robert Glasper and an ensemble of vocalists, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> tracks Common’s intimate journey from childhood to manhood. At its heart, it serves as both an open letter to his estranged father and a personal meditation on the quest for greater self-understanding, self-worth, and connection to the world that surrounds him.</p> <p>As a young artist, introduced to the work of literary icons from James Baldwin and Gwendolyn Brooks to Rakim and Melle Mel, Common would grow to use their works as motivation and a high-water mark for what would become his life in words. In a performance that recounts stories about growing up in Chicago, discovering hip-hop, longing for a consistent father, and his awakening into Black consciousness, the evolution of Common, as son, as man, artist, and activist, is all here - unpacked and laid bare.</p> <p>At just under two hours, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> is constantly in motion, soaring with emotion and pulsing with raw vitality. Seamlessly blending, stretching, and playing with forms, Common slides between poetry and candid conversation, kicks into one of his classic tracks, and backs out into a moment of nearly silent reflection. For those hip-hop heads, the treat of hearing Common bounce between bars of his own self-admitted cringey party raps to rapturously reciting classic hip-hop’s most revered verses is a joy to behold. (Yes, bumping human beatbox included.) In a performance that calls forth the spirit and legacy of so many artists, thinkers, and heroes who informed both his artistry and personal philosophy, Common invites listeners to experience him in his totality. A finely tuned instrument capable of conveying a sweeping breadth of power, range, and tone. Listen to a modern icon deliver at the top of his craft.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-08-04","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Audio Performances & Dramatizations","url":"18571919011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000939/or_orig_000939_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51sWmdvLSzL","asin":"B08DDD5V8J","subHeading":"Raising Kids During a Pandemic","title":"Childhood, Interrupted","authors":"Sanjay Gupta MD","narrators":"Dr. Sanjay Gupta","length":"46 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51+M-7dRqjL","asin":"B08C381LPL","title":"My Mum's a Twat","authors":"Anoushka Warden","narrators":"Susan Wokoma","length":"1 hr and 7 mins"},{"cover":"61CEI+8TpdL","asin":"B086WP794Z","title":"The Sandman","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","narrators":"Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, and others","length":"10 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"51OgbwpJPlL","asin":"B084YVRDJX","subHeading":"As Told to Alex Haley","title":"The Autobiography of Malcolm X","authors":"Malcolm X, Alex Haley","narrators":"Laurence Fishburne","length":"16 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51GgkmxA7wL","asin":"0062989723","subHeading":"The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens","title":"Biography of Resistance","authors":"Muhammad H.

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: \"Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza.

Two of the houses are habitable, while the third is slowly and mysteriously being buried beneath an enormous dune of blindingly white sand. But though long uninhabited, the third house is not empty.

This edition of McDowell's masterpiece of terror features a new introduction by award-winning horror author Michael Rowe. McDowell's first novel, the grisly and darkly comic <i>The Amulet</i> (1979), is also available from Valancourt Books.</p>","releaseDate":"2016-06-24","publishers":[{"name":"Valancourt Books"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Horror","url":"18574490011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/acx0/062117/bk_acx0_062117_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51eElJusMpL","asin":"B01H207CKG","subHeading":"Valancourt 20th Century Classics","title":"Cold Moon over Babylon","authors":"Michael McDowell","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"61U4RglPXfL","asin":"B0765CKNLF","title":"Blackwater: The Complete Saga","authors":"Michael McDowell","narrators":"Matt Godfrey","length":"30 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"517+L4w-fGL","asin":"B074M913S4","title":"The Amulet","authors":"Michael McDowell","narrators":"Julia Whelan","length":"10 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"41wmmurO16L","asin":"B08GPXXMPR","subHeading":"Valancourt 20th Century Classics","title":"Katie","authors":"Michael McDowell","narrators":"Kimberly M.

When confronted with critical decisions about dating, sex, work, even getting dressed in the morning, Iliza argues that women will by nature consider every repercussion of every option before making a move toward what they really want. And that kind of holistic thinking can actually give women an advantage in what is still a male world. </p> <p>In Iliza's own words: \"Understanding Girl Logic is a way of embracing both our aspirations and our contradictions.

He refutes the notion that the one and only solution for those struggling are 12-step programs and provides a guide for those who want a different approach to getting sober.

If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.</p> <p>In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace.

Let's keep that between us.\" (Narrator Nick Offerman) </p> <p>With <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, not even Twain could have known that when he introduced readers to the inhabitants of the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, he would also be introducing two characters - one a clever and mischievous scamp, and the other a carefree, innocent ragamuffin - whose stories would ultimately shape the course of American literature. But whereas its sequel and companion piece, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, would harken an end to childhood, the story of Tom Sawyer is one that depicts the excitement and adventure of boyhood along the Mississippi. </p> <p>Revisit this enduring classic and you will be struck not only by Twain's skill at capturing a time and place so vividly but also by his uncanny ability to crystallize those oftentimes tumultuous and conflicting emotions that a child experiences at the precipice of adulthood: a longing to be free from the rules and obligations of adults while enjoying the laxity inherent in childhood; a love of all things macabre, like blood oaths, cemetery cures, and haunted houses, that reveal a true innocence - an unawareness of real-life consequences and one's own mortality; and the pangs of guilt when knowing the right thing to do and doing the right thing appear to be at odds. </p> <p>A natural storyteller and raconteur in his own right - just listen to <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i> and <i>Gumption</i> - actor, comedian, carpenter, and all-around manly man Nick Offerman (<i>Parks and Recreation</i>) brings his distinctive baritone and a fine-tuned comic versatility to Twain's writing. In a knockout performance, he doesn't so much as read Twain's words as he does rejoice in them, delighting in the hijinks of Tom - whom he lovingly refers to as a \"great scam artist\" and \"true American hero\" - while deftly delivering the tenderness and care Twain gave to his own characters. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-09-20","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/023718/bk_adbl_023718_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"517qEjjMXyL","asin":"B0040J17CW","title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Elijah Wood","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"518gVgBTGpL","asin":"B07V2C16FC","subHeading":"Weirdbey Island, Book 1","title":"The Pirates of Penn Cove","authors":"Eldritch Black","narrators":"J.

Irreverent, unpredictable, and leery of the sports establishment, Knight created the most muscular jock culture in business, a place where employees routinely took two hours at lunch to work out and then strategized late into the night in their holy war against competitors Reebok and Adidas. To outsiders, Nike was a cult. Insiders believed they were furthering the company's mission: to improve the performance of serious athletes. </p> <p>Not everyone could be a Nike guy. It required a certain attitude. For example: Michael Jordan refusing to wear Reebok at the 1992 Olympics, or Charles Barkley joking about becoming a porn star. In <i>Just Do It</i>, award-winning author Donald Katz shows how Nike created the spectacular imagery and marketing campaigns that made Jordan, Barkley, and Bo Jackson international icons. He also documented Nike's increasingly influential role in the management of its high-priced talent, taking us inside lucrative endorsement deals involving Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Deion Sanders, Alonzo Mourning, and Pete Sampras as well as behind-closed-doors negotiations with the NBA and the NCAA as it considered a controversial plan for a collegiate Super Bowl brokered by Nike and super-agent Michael Ovitz. </p> <p>Nike understood the power of imagery and knew how to market those images all over the world. A truly global corporation, Nike relied on capital from Japan to manufacture shoes in Asia sold to one out of every four athletic-shoe buyers in Europe. Katz follows Nike all over the world, taking us from a 19-year-old Korean gluing shoes in a factory, to an advertising wunderkind in Oregon creating the legendary \"Bo Knows\" campaign, to the fanatical Nike kids who rush into stores the day new shoes hit the street. Along the way, Katz describes the creation and design of Nike shoes, revealing technology worthy of a James Bond movie. He examines the charges leveled against Nike: that the company is exploiting Asian peasants, corrupting younger athletes, and recklessly stirring consumer fever in urban America. He also discusses the corporate spirit and strategies that have made Nike one of the great business stories of the late 20th century. </p> <p><i>Just Do It</i> is about the business of sports and the sport of business.

Through a series of hilarious misadventures, Anne's uncompromising spirit makes her a striking presence in the close-knit village, bringing new friendships, first crushes, and, for her foster parents, a love and openness unimaginable before her arrival. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-11-22","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18572491011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/027145/bk_adbl_027145_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61banlnjZ6L","asin":"B00GIQZWPI","subHeading":"Anne of Green Gables Part 2","title":"Anne of Avonlea","authors":"Lucy Maud Montgomery","narrators":"Mary Sarah","length":"9 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51MIXPRnhrL","asin":"B002V8L40E","title":"Anne of the Island","authors":"L.M.

Turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads, the novel tells the unforgettable story of a mental ward and its inhabitants, especially tyrannical Big Nurse Ratched and Randle Patrick McMurphy, the brawling, fun-loving new inmate who resolves to oppose her. We see the story through the eyes of Chief Bromden, the seemingly mute half-Indian patient who witnesses and understands McMurphy's heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them all imprisoned. </p> <p>Hailed upon its publication as a \"glittering parable of good and evil\" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) and a \"roar of protest against middlebrow society's Rules and the invisible Rulers who enforce them\" (<i>Time</i>), Kesey's powerful book went on to sell millions of copies and remains as bracing and insightful today as when it was first released.

While helping repair the marooned time traveler's glider, Cager realizes it can return him to his past to correct a mistake that had haunted him his entire life. As payment for his help, the virtual creature living in the circuitry of the marooned glider, sends Cager back in time as his 10-year-old self, knowing everything he'd known at 80 and gives him access to advanced equations of space and time. </p> <p>But living life over knowing the future isn't as easy as Cager has anticipated. His every action alters the future he remembers until much of what he remembers never happened at all. And those changes work against him at every turn, preventing him correcting the most serious mistake of his life. Now he must use his advanced mathematical ability to build his own time machine to go back and try again. But he needs a fortune even to begin. </p> <p>Then he receives help from a strange young woman with no history. While perfecting time travel, Cager and his new partner overcome enormous problems, even being hunted by dinosaurs in the Cretaceous.

While not every story is concerned with the hard science behind space travel and other futuristic ventures, fiction can give us amazing insight into what we could be capable of and what we dream of doing.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 10 lectures of <i>The Science of Sci-Fi: From Warp Speed to Interstellar Travel</i>, Professor Erin Macdonald interweaves real science and the achievements of the imagination to reveal the truth that underlies our favorite stories and sheds light on what the future may hold. From faster-than-light travel to journeys through time itself, science fiction makes humanity seem limitless. So, what scientific boundaries are we pushing against as we seek to fly among the stars?&nbsp;</p> <p>Beginning with an overview of the physics of time and space as we know them, Professor Macdonald shows how stories extrapolate current knowledge to create visions of the future and how likely - or unlikely - these fictional journeys could be. What would happen if a spaceship flew into a wormhole, as it does in the film <i>Galaxy Quest</i>? Or, if you prefer video games, what would happen if you fired a rocket launcher on the Moon like the soldiers of <i>Mass Effect</i>? Could we ever break the bounds of light speed as they do in <i>Star Wars</i> and move across the universe without spending decades trying to make it to a distant exoplanet? Is the transporter technology of <i>Star Trek</i> really possible?&nbsp;</p> <p>As you look closely at artificial gravity, inertial dampeners, tachyons, red matter, time dilation, and other sci-fi mainstays through the theories of some of science’s greatest thinkers, you will find that your favorite science fiction stories become even more astonishing.</p>","releaseDate":"2019-11-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000746/or_orig_000746_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"514x4dlFUQL","asin":"B082YHVMCG","subHeading":"A Light-Hearted Dark Comedy","title":"Cut and Run","authors":"Ben Acker, Ben Blacker","narrators":"Meg Ryan, D’Arcy Carden, Sam Richardson, and others","length":"2 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"5187T47qS5L","asin":"B07SZJ35BW","subHeading":"A Mother’s Search for Answers in a Dopesick America","title":"Finding Tess","authors":"Beth Macy","narrators":"Beth Macy","length":"5 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"512aPNbydbL","asin":"B084MN6WMT","title":"Certain Woman of an Age","authors":"Margaret Trudeau","narrators":"Margaret Trudeau","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51KAeWlCbuL","asin":"B083MSZTB7","title":"Alone with the Stars","authors":"David R.

In this controversial and exciting listen, Pollan explores caffeine’s power as the most-used drug in the world - and the only one we give to children (in soda pop) as a treat.</p> <p>Pollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history - won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies.

Now, in this Audible Original production, listeners get some of the answers they've waited so long to hear. </p> <p>Featuring an all-new interview with Professor Piexoto, written by Atwood and performed by a full cast, <i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> is a must-listen for both fans and newcomers alike. Emmy Award winner Claire Danes (<i>Homeland</i>, <i>Temple Grandin</i>) gives a stirring performance of this classic in speculative fiction, where the message (and the warning) is now more timely than ever. In addition to rich sound design that honors the audio origins of Atwood's classic, the special edition also includes a brand-new afterword from the author and an essay written by author Valerie Martin (<i>Mary Reilly</i>, <i>Property</i>). </p> <p>After a violent coup in the United States overthrows the Constitution and ushers in a new government regime, the Republic of Gilead imposes subservient roles on all women. Offred, now a Handmaid tasked with the singular role of procreation in the childless household of the enigmatic Commander and his bitter wife, can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost everything, even her own name. Despite the danger, Offred learns to navigate the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life for mere glimpses of her former freedom, and records her story for future listeners. </p> <p>Whether you're a fan of the original novel or someone who has recently discovered it, <i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> will shock, impress, and satisfy all those who listen. </p> <p><i>The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition</i> features performances by Claire Danes, Margaret Atwood, Emily Bauer, Allyson Johnson, Gabra Zackman, Suzanne Toren, Tim Gerard Reynolds, Jennifer Van Dyck, Ray Porter, Emily Cox, Lauren Fortgang, Dan Reiss, Prentice Onayemi, Therese Plummer, and Mark Boyett. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-04-04","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"12h 6m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/030461/bk_adbl_030461_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41lS6XYDwZL","asin":"B07KYVZFT7","subHeading":"The Sequel to The Handmaid's Tale","title":"The Testaments","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Derek Jacobi, Mae Whitman, Ann Dowd, and others","length":"13 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51lBi0nTxhL","asin":"B07612DQ6Q","title":"Alias Grace","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Margaret Atwood, Sarah Gadon","length":"15 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"510aIzH7XfL","asin":"B00M4PXF6K","title":"Fahrenheit 451","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"Tim Robbins","length":"5 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"51qLjWpd7XL","asin":"B011PVTC5G","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Heart Goes Last","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Cassandra Campbell, Mark Deakins","length":"12 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51PG+W+o1pL","asin":"B002UZKX5K","title":"Oryx and Crake","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Campbell Scott","length":"10 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51vV-Rvl+RL","asin":"B07FSNSLZ1","title":"Where the Crawdads Sing","authors":"Delia Owens","narrators":"Cassandra Campbell","length":"12 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"617imZ75zSL","asin":"B002UZKYDQ","title":"The Help","authors":"Kathryn Stockett","narrators":"Jenna Lamia, Bahni Turpin, Octavia Spencer, and others","length":"18 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"61LdvZa6UeL","asin":"B002V1CIII","title":"The Year of the Flood","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Bernadette Dunne, Katie MacNichol, Mark Bramhall","length":"14 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51AyV7rsScL","asin":"B015ELUYL4","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five","authors":"Kurt Vonnegut","narrators":"James Franco","length":"5 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"511ewzvkNnL","asin":"B00NJ58S5W","subHeading":"Nine Tales","title":"Stone Mattress","authors":"Margaret Atwood","narrators":"Margaret Atwood, Rob Delaney, Mark Bramhall, and others","length":"10 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"6132R6AHGjL","asin":"125031724X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Four Winds","authors":"Kristin Hannah","narrators":"Julia Whelan","length":"15 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51T5CEZ57aL","asin":"B07LCV3R2F","title":"The Color Purple","authors":"Alice Walker","narrators":"Alice Walker","length":"7 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"611Eot7+zJL","asin":"B005GFQ5WQ","title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","authors":"Alexandre Dumas","narrators":"Bill Homewood","length":"52 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51IbuiT-ndL","asin":"B00ELMXI0M","title":"The Goldfinch","authors":"Donna Tartt","narrators":"David Pittu","length":"32 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51s+psVOQvL","asin":"B07H7TT7GM","subHeading":"The Untold Story of the Golden State Killer Investigation","title":"Evil Has a Name","authors":"Paul Holes, Jim Clemente, Peter McDonnell","narrators":"Paul Holes, Jim Clemente","length":"6 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51Agd5ompoL","asin":"B01A9ATMCM","title":"The Bell Jar","authors":"Sylvia Plath","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","length":"7 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51vksp09TJL","asin":"B0077DEH7A","title":"The Stand","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"47 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"517pfctTa9L","asin":"B002V0Q4LG","subHeading":"A Fable About Following Your Dream","title":"The Alchemist","authors":"Paulo Coelho","narrators":"Jeremy Irons","length":"4 hrs"}],"added":155},{"asin":"B008K8BQG6","cover":"51HWXRj3OoL","title":"Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture","authors":[{"name":"David Kushner","url":"B001IXU58U"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Wil Wheaton"}],"blurb":"Masters of Doom is the amazing true story of the Lennon and McCartney of video games: John Carmack and John Romero....","downloaded":true,"length":"12h 43m","progress":0,"titleShort":"Masters of Doom","ratings":4604,"rating":4.6,"summary":"<p><i>Masters of Doom</i> is the amazing true story of the Lennon and McCartney of video games: John Carmack and John Romero.

Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Carolina in My Mind\", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, \"the source of many of my songs\", and <i>Break Shot</i> is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going \"beyond the spoken word\", <i>Break Shot </i>combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn \"Jerusalem\", selections from his newest release <i>American Standard</i>, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for <i>Break Shot</i> and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.</p> <p>Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, <i>Sweet Baby James</i>, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21.</p> <p>Journey with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts - and a beloved voice to millions.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-01-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Music","url":"18571942011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000937/or_orig_000937_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"512bSM2nZYL","asin":"B08WWKQFC4","title":"Upon Reflection","authors":"Sting","narrators":"Sting","length":"1 hr and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51asnHGkyYL","asin":"B007FWKZK6","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"A Natural Woman","authors":"Carole King","narrators":"Carole King","length":"14 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51xASJ4U9zL","asin":"B005CJA99Q","subHeading":"The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY and the Lost Story of 1970","title":"Fire and Rain","authors":"David Browne","narrators":"Sean Runnette","length":"11 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61aOkjfK1gL","asin":"B0167DFJOA","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"Boys in the Trees","authors":"Carly Simon","narrators":"Carly Simon","length":"13 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51DZeZw7K0L","asin":"0593294181","title":"Greenlights","authors":"Matthew McConaughey","narrators":"Matthew McConaughey","length":"6 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51PsnheQZ6L","asin":"B08KWNTR1M","title":"Alanis Morissette: Words + Music","authors":"Alanis Morissette","narrators":"Alanis Morissette","length":"1 hr and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51o+qu3L3PL","asin":"1549185594","title":"The Last Days of John Lennon","authors":"James Patterson, Casey Sherman, Dave Wedge","narrators":"Matthew Wolf, K.

For the band and their fans, R40 was a celebration and, perhaps, a farewell. But for Neil Peart, each tour is more than just a string of concerts; it's an opportunity to explore backroads near and far on his BMW motorcycle. So if this was to be the last tour and the last great adventure, he decided it would have to be the best one, onstage and off.&nbsp;</p> <p>This third volume in Peart's travel series shares all-new tales that transport the listener across North America and through memories of 50 years of playing drums.

The creative and technical logistics that go into building today's hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In <i>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</i>, Jason Schreier takes listeners on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius. Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-size monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, <i>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</i> reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisyphean - it's nothing short of miraculous. </p> <p>Taking some of the most popular, best-selling recent games, Schreier immerses listeners in the hellfire of the development process, whether it's RPG studio Bioware's challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>; indie developer Eric Barone's single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG <i>Stardew Valley</i> from one man's vision into a multimillion-dollar franchise; or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create <i>Destiny</i>, a brand-new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings - even as it nearly ripped their studio apart. </p> <p>Documenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, <i>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</i> is a journey through development hell - and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-09-05","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/006202/bk_harp_006202_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"517wJOQwg+L","asin":"1541406389","subHeading":"The Psychology of Video Games and Their Impact on the People who Play Them","title":"Getting Gamers","authors":"Jamie Madigan","narrators":"Stephen Bel Davies","length":"11 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51AoR1yX9nL","asin":"B00JQN221C","subHeading":"Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle That Defined a Generation","title":"Console Wars","authors":"Blake J.

By 1939, a massive rally of some 20,000 homegrown Nazi supporters was held in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. While across the Hudson River in Newark, New Jersey, the town’s large German population stepped up Nazi recruitment activity. Pro-fascist groups staged parades, screened anti-Semitic films, and organized boycotts of Jewish businesses and politicians throughout the city. Complicating matters, Newark was also the epicenter of the Jewish mob.</p> <p>Abner 'Longie' Zwillman, known as the \"Al Capone of New Jersey\", had made a fortune in gambling, bootlegging, racketeering, and controlled the city’s ports and police force. Not surprisingly, this powerful Jewish gangster took exception to the Nazi’s anti-Semitic platform. In response, Zwillman helped organize a group of ex-boxers, factory workers, and students to defend the city’s Jewish interests. The group dubbed themselves the Minutemen - ready at a moment’s notice - and took to breaking up Nazi gatherings using an intimidating combination of stink bombs, baseball bats, brass knuckles, and pure chutzpah.</p> <p>Greg Donahue’s <i>The Minuteman</i> tells the story of one of Newark’s native sons - ex-prizefighter and longtime Zwillman enforcer Sidney Abramowitz, aka Nat Arno - who took over leadership of the Minutemen in 1934 and made it his personal business to put an end to what he saw as the homegrown Nazi movement’s \"anti-American\" activities. For six years, Arno and his crew of vigilantes battled Newark’s Nazis at every turn. <i>The Minuteman</i> is a story of the ethics of violence in the face of fascism - a forgotten legacy that is as relevant now as it was nearly a hundred years ago.</p> <p><b>Photos Included in Cover Art Courtesy of the Jewish Historical Society of New Jersey - Warren Grover Collection</b></p>","releaseDate":"2020-01-02","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Americas","url":"18573526011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000537/or_orig_000537_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51KAeWlCbuL","asin":"B083MSZTB7","title":"Alone with the Stars","authors":"David R.

Curated by Teatro Luna West: America's All Latinx and All Women of Color Theatre Ensemble, these stunning stories are combined with original music by Maria Chavez and poetry by Gabriela Ortega in order to fully transport the listener to each individual life and journey.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although rooted in the incredibly diverse spectrum that is the US Latina experience, this collection of stories is crafted for anyone who has ever felt invisible, powerless, or alone. This compilation provides a platform and much needed space for the many generations of women who have been tucked away into the corners of our history, erased, and ignored and shines a light on vibrant voices of today celebrating our power to heal, transform, and rise again. From interviewing public figures as problematic as Fidel Castro, to experiencing a leaky brain and the miraculous feats of modern medicine or losing a loved one to the brutalities of Alzheimer's, these storytellers share it all. Modeling vulnerability for the listener, we are given access to somber reflections on the current administration's impact on the marginalized - from those in violent cycles of poverty to those experiencing the gentrification crisis firsthand, to a passionate call to remember the children still in cages.

It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email.

Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him.

On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.</p> <p><i>A View from a Hill </i>- adapted by Mark Morris</p> <p>Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins.

For over 1,500 years, the Arthurian narrative has enthralled writers, artists, and a limitless audience spanning the Western world and beyond - and its appeal continues unabated in our time. No other heroic figure in literature compares with King Arthur in terms of global popularity and longevity; now, each year sees literally thousands of new versions of the story appear across diverse media, from fiction writing and visual arts to film and popular culture. Delve into the historical mystery behind the figure of Arthur, and discover the magnificent breadth of these epic tales. </p> <p>These 24 spellbinding lectures reveal the full scope of the Arthurian tradition, from its beginnings in post-Roman Britain to its extraordinary trajectory across the centuries and its latest incarnations in modern times. Your pathfinder in this world of mythic adventure and romance, Professor Armstrong, is one of the world's leading Arthurian scholars and the current editor-in-chief of the academic journal <i>Arthuriana</i>. Demonstrating both encyclopedic knowledge and an infectious passion for the subject, she leads you in tracing how the myth developed across time, clarifying many misunderstood aspects of the narrative, such as the origins of the Round Table and the figure of Merlin, the illicit love between Lancelot and Guenevere, and the varied manifestations of the magical Holy Grail. You'll discover how the legend was appropriated and assimilated by differing cultures, and how each writer and artist in the tradition reflected and commented, through the Arthurian narrative, on the concerns of their own time and place. The result is an illuminating look at one of the most engaging, entertaining, and influential legendary traditions the world has ever known.</p>","releaseDate":"2015-04-08","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Europe","url":"18573582011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000404/bk_tcco_000404_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51WZ8W8aicL","asin":"B07XGD3WKH","title":"Medieval Myths & Mysteries","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"5 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"413rTBB7ZvL","asin":"B00KQV67YG","title":"Great Minds of the Medieval World","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"11 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"61uBSgRDXZL","asin":"B01FWOO4C8","title":"The Black Death: The World's Most Devastating Plague","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"12 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"511fNQRbO-L","asin":"B00DGBC6Y8","title":"The Story of Medieval England: From King Arthur to the Tudor Conquest","authors":"Jennifer Paxton, The Great Courses","narrators":"Jennifer Paxton","length":"19 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51aEF-JMX8L","asin":"1629977322","title":"Years That Changed History: 1215","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"12 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"41FHD7QhiGL","asin":"B00DGU7Y6Y","title":"Turning Points in Medieval History","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"12 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"51sIAW5-H8L","asin":"1629977381","title":"Warriors, Queens, and Intellectuals: 36 Great Women Before 1400","authors":"Joyce E.

Second, you'll delve into the historical contexts and individual lives of the four sages, and how the religious and philosophical traditions we associate with them came into being. The lectures serve as a unique window on the origins of these traditions, through their focus on the teachings, actions, and historical roles of the sages who inspired them. In uncovering the original wisdom and practices of each sage, you'll grapple with key questions. How did each man understand the nature of the universe? How did each envision the human self? What did they each see as the path to true self-realization? In words reflecting profound and compassionate insight, these lectures bring the teachings vividly alive as they speak to their essential purpose and as they shed light on the choices we all face, moment by moment, in living deliberately and savoring life to the fullest. </p>","releaseDate":"2013-07-08","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"length":"18h 56m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000066/bk_tcco_000066_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51titl963KL","asin":"B00D9411UW","title":"Cultural Literacy for Religion: Everything the Well-Educated Person Should Know","authors":"Mark Berkson, The Great Courses","narrators":"Mark Berkson","length":"12 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51xCFRa980L","asin":"B00DDUVALC","title":"Buddhism","authors":"Malcolm David Eckel, The Great Courses","narrators":"Malcolm David Eckel","length":"12 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51n3ihZ-s7L","asin":"1629978078","title":"Understanding the Old Testament","authors":"Professor Robert D.

No topic is too lowly for the author's wonder and admiration, from the careful choreography of breaking wind to the precise internal communication required for a cleansing vomit. Along the way, the author provides practical advice, such as the best ways to sit on the toilet to have a comfortable bowel movement, how clean your kitchen should be for optimum gut health, and how different laxatives work. She tells stories of gut bacteria that can lead to obesity, autoimmune diseases, or even suicide, and she discusses the benefits of dietary supplements, such as probiotics. </p> <p>This book is a fascinating primer for anyone interested in how our ideas about the gut are changing in the light of cutting-edge scientific research. In the words of the author, \"We live in an era in which we are just beginning to understand just how complex the connections are between us, our food, our pets, and the microscopic world in, on, and around us. We are gradually decoding processes that we used to believe were part of our inescapable destiny.\" </p>","releaseDate":"2016-02-17","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/026600/bk_adbl_026600_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51dUyZcsyTL","asin":"1980002444","subHeading":"The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flow Through Our Lives","title":"Liquid Rules","authors":"Mark Miodownik","narrators":"Michael Page","length":"7 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"61C0Ve4iDPL","asin":"B07C35RV3F","subHeading":"A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes","title":"Human Errors","authors":"Nathan H.

Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind them are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. These dynamic and illuminating lectures begin with a brief overview of theories of physical reality starting with Aristotle and culminating in Newtonian or \"classical\" physics. After that, you'll follow along as Professor Wolfson outlines the logic that led to Einstein's profound theory of special relativity and the simple yet far-reaching insight on which it rests. With that insight in mind, you'll move on to consider Einstein's theory of general relativity and its interpretation of gravitation in terms of the curvature of space and time. </p> <p>From there, you'll embark on a dazzling exploration of how inquiry into matter at the atomic and subatomic scales led to quandaries that are resolved-or at least clarified-by quantum mechanics, a vision of physical reality so profound and so at odds with our experience that it nearly defies language. </p> <p>By bringing relativity and quantum mechanics into the same picture, you'll chart the development of fascinating hypotheses about the origin, development, and possible futures of the entire universe, as well as the possibility that physics can produce a \"theory of everything\" to account for all aspects of the physical world.

Yet the New Testament is not only one of Western civilization’s most believed books, but also one of its most widely disputed, often maligned, and least clearly understood, with a vast number of people unaware of how it was written and transmitted. </p> <p>But now a distinguished religious scholar is available to help you gain a carefully reasoned understanding of not only the New Testament itself, but of the individuals and communities who created its texts. </p> <p>Drawing on modern biblical scholarship, recent archaeological discoveries, and careful literary analysis - and approaching his subject purely as a historian, with belief or disbelief suspended - Professor Ehrman has crafted a series of 24 fascinating lectures that trace the history of the New Testament and the early Christian faith community. He discusses not only the 27 books included in the New Testament, but also many of the significant texts that were excluded as he addresses key historical questions around the issues of authorship, circumstance, audience, content, meaning, and historical accuracy. </p> <p>\"Our ultimate goal,\" he notes, \"is to come to a fuller appreciation and understanding of these books that have made such an enormous impact on the history of Western civilization and that continue to play such an important role for people today.\"</p>","releaseDate":"2013-07-08","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"length":"12h 27m ","categories":[{"name":"Religion & Spirituality","url":"18574839011"},{"name":"Christianity","url":"18574854011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000308/bk_tcco_000308_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41Z-mPke6ZL","asin":"B00DII1TBA","title":"The Old Testament","authors":"Amy-Jill Levine, The Great Courses","narrators":"Amy-Jill Levine","length":"12 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51n3ihZ-s7L","asin":"1629978078","title":"Understanding the Old Testament","authors":"Professor Robert D.

When the wily warrior-king Odysseus sets off for home after the Trojan War, he doesn’t realize this simple undertaking will become a perilous journey of 10 years. Beset at every turn, he encounters obstacles, detours, and temptations—both supernatural and human—while his wife Penelope fends off would-be suitors desperate to take the throne.</p> <p>Emily Wilson is the first woman to take on the daunting task of translating over 100,000 lines of a three-millennium-old poem from Ancient Greek to modern-day English.

The result is a lean, fleet-footed translation that recaptures Homer’s “nimble gallop” and brings an ancient epic to new life.

After all, can you fall in love with someone you’re not sure you really even know?</p>","releaseDate":"2019-01-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Romance","url":"18580518011"},{"name":"Contemporary","url":"18580522011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000518/or_orig_000518_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51MJb5KRdjL","asin":"B07L9HXHZ6","title":"Birthday Suit","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Sebastian York, January Lavoy, and others","length":"7 hrs and 16 mins"},{"cover":"51snJL3puUL","asin":"B07RXMCMND","title":"Never Have I Ever","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Amanda Ronconi, Jason Clarke","length":"8 hrs and 20 mins"},{"cover":"51R5CZ2d-9L","asin":"B07QHYRJ93","subHeading":"Caught Up In Love, Book 2","title":"The Dating Proposal","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Sebastian York","length":"6 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"51kH+18xRvL","asin":"B07VT79466","title":"Instant Gratification","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Shane East, Sebastian York, and others","length":"8 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"5190an+ulaL","asin":"B0815BGB9B","title":"Scrooged","authors":"Vi Keeland, Penelope Ward","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Sebastian York","length":"2 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51JvXbhUqVL","asin":"B08TDVB566","title":"My One Week Husband","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Shane East, Vanessa Edwin, Erin Mallon, and others","length":"7 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51nHvTBoNfL","asin":"B07QW9S6JX","title":"Satisfaction Guaranteed","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Jason Clarke, Andi Arndt, Shane East, and others","length":"6 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"51Q0fA17f6L","asin":"1549121944","title":"Meet Cute","authors":"Helena Hunting","narrators":"Holly Warren, Teddy Hamilton","length":"9 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51u359PsEiL","asin":"B08BCVL1CH","title":"The What If Guy","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Joe Arden, Andi Arndt, Santino Fontana, and others","length":"6 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51l5hGdlE+L","asin":"B0812B2SM2","subHeading":"Always Satisfied, Book 0.5","title":"Delayed Satisfaction","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Jason Clarke","length":"56 mins"},{"cover":"51mzqWiAlQL","asin":"B08QBQWMBS","title":"The Invitation","authors":"Vi Keeland","narrators":"Sebastian York, Andi Arndt","length":"8 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51OvEG8vNdL","asin":"B08158F57N","title":"Asking for a Friend","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Jason Clarke, Zachary Webber, and others","length":"6 hrs"},{"cover":"51+GF7ctSHL","asin":"B08VC2FBP1","title":"The Crush","authors":"Penelope Ward","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Sebastian York","length":"8 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51hm9Q2-TiL","asin":"B07WQYDQJW","title":"Park Avenue Player","authors":"Penelope Ward, Vi Keeland","narrators":"Sebastian York, Andi Arndt","length":"9 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51GZWpX+PGL","asin":"B08B1YC13H","title":"The Rivals","authors":"Vi Keeland","narrators":"Sebastian York, Andi Arndt","length":"8 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51yQmzQenxL","asin":"B077BK6YQF","title":"Wanderlust","authors":"Lauren Blakely","narrators":"Richard Armitage, Grace Grant","length":"8 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51OpDmXSsOL","asin":"B07QN1N3PY","title":"Getting Played","authors":"Emma Chase","narrators":"Andi Arndt, Zachary Webber","length":"6 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"515JBKgJJVL","asin":"B07HNJKKBB","title":"Hate Notes","authors":"Vi Keeland, Penelope Ward","narrators":"Sebastian York, Lynn Barrington","length":"8 hrs and 17 mins"}],"added":51},{"asin":"B07M79GGYT","cover":"51k972p7p9L","title":"Sovereign","authors":[{"name":"Jeff Hirsch","url":"B004LZQFBI"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Jesse Einstein"}],"blurb":"Micah Cole and his parents has been in deep space for three years on a mission to find intelligence.

Each of his 24 lectures covers a notable incident of financial misfortune or folly that is worthy of a Hollywood thriller. You hear how Charles Ponzi conducted the moneymaking scam that bears his name; how mining companies in the Old West sprang up like Internet start-ups, with a similar imbalance of winners and losers; how hyperinflation destroyed Germany’s economy at the beginning of 1920s and how its resulting stock market crash nearly sank America’s stock market.</p> <p>You also hear how the Great Depression deepened through a wave of bank panics; how, in more recent times, the US savings and loan industry went belly-up; how Orange County in California went bankrupt, how Japan’s hard-charging economy came to a screeching halt; how currency crises swept the globe; how subprime mortgages nearly sparked a second Great Depression; and much more. You also learn how technology has transformed stock trading, how cryptocurrencies work, and why we live in an era of financial instability.</p> <p>As well as entertaining you with riveting stories, Professor Fullenkamp inoculates you against the gullibility, overconfidence, and herd mentality that have trapped even Wall Street professionals in misguided investments that lost billions. You won’t have any trouble staying awake through these stimulating lectures. And, armed with the knowledge of how to stay out of harm’s way, you may even sleep better at night.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2018-08-17","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"World","url":"18573695011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001001/bk_tcco_001001_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51Z+Vt0dIFL","asin":"1629976741","title":"How the Earth Works","authors":"Michael E.

In<i> Ancient Civilizations of North America</i>, Professor Edwin Barnhart, Director of the Maya Exploration Center, will open your eyes to a fascinating world you never knew existed - even though you’ve been living right next to it, or even on top of it, for as long as you’ve been on the continent.&nbsp;</p> <p>The peoples of ancient North America were exceptionally knowledgeable about their environment, but their intellectual and artistic curiosity went much beyond the immediate need for food and safety. Beginning thousands of years ago, and without benefit of written language, native peoples became mathematicians, construction and soil engineers, astronomers, urban planners, and more. They developed thriving cities, extensive trade routes, canals to bring water to the desert, and earthworks we still marvel over today.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 24 exciting lectures, you’ll learn about the vibrant cities of Poverty Point, the first city in North America, built about 3,500 years ago, and Cahokia, the largest city of ancient North America. You’ll explore the many ways in which the Chacoan environment provided cultural and religious focus for peoples of the southwest.

Also looking for Moss is the aging Sheriff Bell, a World War II veteran who may be Moss' only hope for survival.</p> <p>Raw and lean, <i>No Country for Old Men</i> is another masterpiece from one of America's acclaimed novelists.</p>","releaseDate":"2005-07-22","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/000609/bk_reco_000609_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"511jZd5pZxL","asin":"B002V8N2UE","subHeading":"Or the Evening Redness in the West","title":"Blood Meridian","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Richard Poe","length":"13 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"41EezCSkduL","asin":"B002V0PTQ2","title":"The Road","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Tom Stechschulte","length":"6 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"51DyUdS6Q5L","asin":"B0036MQ89Q","subHeading":"The Border Trilogy, Book One","title":"All the Pretty Horses","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Frank Muller","length":"10 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"51cPN1Rnr+L","asin":"B00ADRK9FG","title":"Child of God","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Tom Stechschulte","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51fFgvLwl4L","asin":"B00BSUUIRQ","title":"Outer Dark","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Ed Sala","length":"7 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61ilMNSXWQL","asin":"B01C95W22C","subHeading":"The Border Trilogy, Book Two","title":"The Crossing","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Richard Poe","length":"14 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51k2RJ1tO2L","asin":"B008RZARVC","title":"Suttree","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Richard Poe","length":"20 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51zcUbNtkeL","asin":"B004QP2EEK","subHeading":"The Border Trilogy, Book Three","title":"Cities of the Plain","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Frank Muller","length":"9 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51SrGRsj63L","asin":"B00D7MM1WS","title":"The Orchard Keeper","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Ed Sala","length":"8 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"61iqHClgGmL","asin":"B00RKMHUYU","subHeading":"A Novel of Revenge","title":"The Revenant","authors":"Michael Punke","narrators":"Holter Graham","length":"9 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"410Ve8jsecL","asin":"B0040TOF76","subHeading":"A Novel in Dramatic Form","title":"The Sunset Limited","authors":"Cormac McCarthy","narrators":"Austin Pendleton, Ezra Knight, Tom Stechschulte","length":"1 hr and 42 mins"},{"cover":"515xwDG-3oL","asin":"B005C4FKDG","title":"The Devil All the Time","authors":"Donald Ray Pollock","narrators":"Mark Bramhall","length":"9 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"5106jN4KGNL","asin":"B002V1O4XU","title":"American Psycho","authors":"Bret Easton Ellis","narrators":"Pablo Schreiber","length":"16 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"61QX3InGC-L","asin":"B002V5GORK","title":"True Grit","authors":"Charles Portis","narrators":"Donna Tartt","length":"6 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"61mf+Ed41IL","asin":"B002V1BFI2","title":"Fight Club","authors":"Chuck Palahniuk","narrators":"Jim Colby","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51r4Oy-bgeL","asin":"B004WFXAF6","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Sisters Brothers","authors":"Patrick deWitt","narrators":"John Pruden","length":"7 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"41ZUtTkQnuL","asin":"B008Z2NTO4","title":"Trainspotting","authors":"Irvine Welsh","narrators":"Tam Dean Burn","length":"12 hrs and 1 min"},{"cover":"61nTO13NJNL","asin":"B07BGQ2ZQ3","title":"Lonesome Dove","authors":"Larry McMurtry","narrators":"Lee Horsley","length":"36 hrs and 47 mins"}],"added":33},{"asin":"B002V1NHJ2","cover":"51gOejv1j1L","title":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe: The Chronicles of Narnia","authors":[{"name":"C.S.

Caro: a short, penetrating reflection on the evolution and workings of political power - for good and for ill.</b> </p> <p> In <i>On Power</i>, an Audible exclusive, the legendary historian Robert A. Caro reflects on what drew him as a young journalist to study political power and what his half century of reporting on New York City urban planner Robert Moses and President Lyndon Johnson has taught him about the inner workings of government and democracy. </p> <p>Adapted by the author from two recent speeches and filled with thoughtful lessons and personal moments, <i>On Power</i> goes behind the scenes in the author's decades-long quest to understand how power works, often in ways he could have never imagined. </p> <p>Listening to <i>On Power</i>, narrated with emotion and humor by Caro in his unmistakable New York accent, is like having a private audience with the author often hailed as our greatest living historian. Longtime fans of Caro's books, as well as those seeking a more personal introduction to his life and work, will be treated to his trademark wit and revelatory insight. </p> <p>But more than anything, <i>On Power</i> is a timely reminder for those who want to better understand how power and government work. </p> <p>In Caro's words: \"Why political power? Because it shapes all of our lives. It shapes your life in ways that you might never think about. Every time a young man goes to college on a federal education bill passed by Lyndon Johnson, that's political power. And so is a young man dying in Vietnam. Every time an elderly person is able to afford an MRI, that's Medicare. That's political power. It affects your life in all sorts of ways. My books are an attempt to explain this power.... Because the more America understands about political power, the better informed our votes will be, and then, hopefully, the better our democracy should be.\" </p>","releaseDate":"2017-05-09","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"18574641011"},{"name":"Politics & Government","url":"18574665011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000012/or_orig_000012_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"412VW5GnlDL","asin":"0593147103","title":"Working","authors":"Robert A.

Believe it or not, our bodies speak louder than our words. Postures, gestures, and expressions convey reams of information - and often not what you'd expect. A smile, for example, is usually considered welcoming. But crook one corner of your mouth higher, and you project superiority, subconsciously chasing other people away. <i>Without Saying a Word</i> explains how even the subtlest motions have meaning.</p> <p>Distilling decades of research, the book deciphers these unspoken signals: from facial expressions and fleeting micro expressions to positive and negative body language. Discover which postures and gestures indicate confidence and build rapport - and which reveal disinterest, arrogance, or even aggression. Learn to end off-putting habits, accentuate good ones, and become an authentic and effective communicator.</p> <p>Exhibiting body language that is open, honest, and self-assured increases your social influence and enhances your skill as a negotiator...while the ability to read the emotions and intentions of others is equally indispensable. Whether you're making a presentation, pitching a project, or closing a deal, the right body language can be your best ally.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2018-07-24","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Career Success","url":"18572070011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/011834/bk_blak_011834_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51hAGh15bTL","asin":"B013F5WEZK","subHeading":"92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships","title":"How to Talk to Anyone","authors":"Leil Lowndes","narrators":"Joyce Bean, Leil Lowndes","length":"8 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51n-FVT8y1L","asin":"B01ACARLMM","subHeading":"How to Think and Act Like the Most Successful and Highest-Paid People in Every Field","title":"Get Smart","authors":"Brian Tracy","narrators":"Brian Tracy","length":"4 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51MRbyUYr2L","asin":"B00CFND1RE","subHeading":"Take Your Career from Average to Exceptional with the Hidden Power of Nonverbal Intelligence","title":"Louder Than Words","authors":"Joe Navarro, Toni Sciarra Poynter","narrators":"Paul Costanzo","length":"6 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51Kmtn3f-QL","asin":"0062969137","subHeading":"A Field Guide to Human Behavior","title":"The Dictionary of Body Language","authors":"Joe Navarro","narrators":"Dave Clark","length":"3 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51zUBF-mEAL","asin":"B006ZAR44Y","subHeading":"An Ex-FBI Agent’s Guide to Speed-Reading People","title":"What Every BODY Is Saying","authors":"Joe Navarro, Marvin Karlins","narrators":"Paul Costanzo","length":"7 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51R6B8Gj6GL","asin":"B077Z8S58Y","subHeading":"The Magic Words for Influence and Impact","title":"Exactly What to Say","authors":"Phil M.

But your initial instinct couldn't be further from the truth. You just haven't budgeted the right way. </p> <p><i>You Need a Budget</i> will teach you four simple rules to completely revolutionize the way you think about managing your money. With a budget, you'll break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, get out of debt, and save more money. A liberating, enabling, empowering budget will actually make you feel more free, not more restricted. The YNAB philosophy is centered around these four rules: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Give every dollar a job. Take your cash, checking, and saving accounts and assign jobs to that money. Begin now with what you have on hand. Then follow your plan. Pick your priorities, and make sure your dollars are helping you move closer to the things you care about most. </li> <li>Embrace your true expenses. Look ahead and identify the larger, less frequent expenses that tend to sneak up on you. Break those expenses into manageable monthly amounts. Consider insurance premiums, birthdays, holidays, charitable giving, car repairs, etc. This practice evens out your cash outflows, decreases your stress, and helps you make better decisions. </li> <li>Roll with the punches. Accept the fact that life always changes and you'll likely always go over budget somewhere. If an unexpected expense comes up and you need to change your budget, just change it. The YNAB philosophy not only tolerates changing your budget but encourages it. </li> <li>Age your money. The goal of this rule is to increase the time between the moment you earn money and the moment you spend that money. In other words, if you're going to break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, you need to learn to live on money you earned a month or two months or even three months ago. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>YNAB's four rules are the pillars of a tried-and-true system that gets you to engage with your money every day. It helps you change your behavior so that you're proactive and in control of your finances. It's not about stressing over last month's statement; instead, you're looking ahead and actively deciding how you want and need to build a life of meaning, not stress. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-12-26","publishers":[{"name":"HarperAudio"}],"length":"4h 54m ","categories":[{"name":"Money & Finance","url":"18574547011"},{"name":"Personal Finance","url":"18574581011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/006458/bk_harp_006458_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51iqGSp0h8L","asin":"B01B25Z6B4","subHeading":"Learn Key Strategies to Set Up a Budget, Make the Most of Your Money","title":"The 21-Day Budgeting Challenge","authors":"21 Day Challenges","narrators":"Francie Wyck","length":"1 hr and 4 mins"},{"cover":"517lVpSW+vL","asin":"B082VKHVCL","subHeading":"The Small Changes That Change Everything","title":"Tiny Habits","authors":"BJ Fogg PhD","narrators":"BJ Fogg PhD","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51QO51sj31L","asin":"B002UUKIR8","subHeading":"A Proven Plan for Financial Fitness","title":"The Total Money Makeover","authors":"Dave Ramsey","narrators":"Dave Ramsey","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"41dLQKEe5rL","asin":"1549199927","subHeading":"A Very Practical Guide","title":"How to Have Impossible Conversations","authors":"Peter Boghossian, James Lindsay","narrators":"Peter Boghossian","length":"6 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"61jnwCXDEjL","asin":"B0797F57JK","subHeading":"Achieving Financial Independence Through Simple Living","title":"Meet the Frugalwoods","authors":"Elizabeth Willard Thames","narrators":"Ann Marie Gideon","length":"5 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51n-FVT8y1L","asin":"B01ACARLMM","subHeading":"How to Think and Act Like the Most Successful and Highest-Paid People in Every Field","title":"Get Smart","authors":"Brian Tracy","narrators":"Brian Tracy","length":"4 hrs and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51Exvba2udL","asin":"B01NBWW2H5","subHeading":"Leveraging Influence When You Lack Authority","title":"How to Lead When You're Not in Charge","authors":"Clay Scroggins","narrators":"Clay Scroggins, Gabe Wicks","length":"6 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51nS68fUP9L","asin":"1549127136","subHeading":"How to Win the Game of Life","title":"No Stopping You!","authors":"Roger E.

If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.</b> </p> <p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive 21st-century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realizing there's a better way. </p> <p>In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules\", for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill. </p> <p>A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the listener on a journey through memorable stories - from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business-class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air - and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide for anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-01-05","publishers":[{"name":"Hachette Audio"}],"length":"7h 44m ","categories":[{"name":"Business & Careers","url":"18572029011"},{"name":"Career Success","url":"18572070011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/hach/002350/bk_hach_002350_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51FteuQ37hL","asin":"B00995OX28","subHeading":"Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You","authors":"Cal Newport","narrators":"Dave Mallow","length":"6 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"61zsCT1axRL","asin":"B07LGF8TCJ","subHeading":"Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World","title":"Digital Minimalism","authors":"Cal Newport","narrators":"Will Damron, Cal Newport","length":"6 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"41VQ+D8nUEL","asin":"0525643575","subHeading":"Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload","title":"A World Without Email","authors":"Cal Newport","narrators":"Kevin R.

That trying to change bad habits can seem impossible? Or that real fulfillment can be elusive, despite living a successful life?&nbsp;</p> <p>Often, such difficulties stem from the human brain's hardwired tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Modern science demonstrates that this survival mechanism served the needs of our earliest ancestors, but is at the root of many problems that we face today, such as depression, compulsive and addictive behaviors, chronic pain, and stress and anxiety.&nbsp;</p> <p>For thousands of years, people have used mindfulness practices to deal effectively with a wide range of life challenges. But how exactly does mindfulness work, in scientific terms? How can the human brain, which gives rise to so many of our problems, actually provide a solution?&nbsp;</p> <p>We are now in the midst of an explosion of scientific research demonstrating that mindfulness practice changes both the function and the structure of the brain. Numerous studies show which parts of the brain are affected by mindfulness practice, and how these neurobiological changes benefit our minds and bodies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, in the 24 fascinating lectures of <i>The Science of Mindfulness</i>, Professor Siegel, a clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical School, reveals the science behind mindfulness in compelling detail and demonstrates its application to a wide range of issues - psychological, social, and medical. You'll examine the neurobiology underlying ancient practices that are now profoundly influencing the contemporary world. And you'll learn many practical ways you can use mindfulness techniques in your own life.&nbsp;</p> <p>This playful, caring course demonstrates the effectiveness of mindfulness in responding to many of humanity's fundamental existential problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, this audiobook has complementary soundtracks, which are included in the audiobook from chapters 25 to 29.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-08-22","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"length":"13h 53m ","categories":[{"name":"Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development","url":"18574784011"},{"name":"Personal Development","url":"18574800011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000386/bk_tcco_000386_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51UiDusGGmL","asin":"B00ZB7Q1RS","subHeading":"Techniques for Retraining Your Brain","title":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","authors":"Jason M.

You'll meet the likes of William Caxton, England's first printer who not only printed and distributed a variety of works but also often had to translate them himself; learn about Hugh of Payns and the role of his Knights Templar - organized for the protection of pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem - in the creation of the first modern bank; see how communities dealt with marriage in a time when the church had not yet drawn this institution into its orbit; and much more. </p> <p>Rich with information and period detail (including revealing examples of medieval literature from the English, French, Norse, Icelandic, and Italian worlds), these lectures will dramatically increase your understanding of how lives in the Middle Ages were really lived.</p>","releaseDate":"2013-07-08","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000203/bk_tcco_000203_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"511fNQRbO-L","asin":"B00DGBC6Y8","title":"The Story of Medieval England: From King Arthur to the Tudor Conquest","authors":"Jennifer Paxton, The Great Courses","narrators":"Jennifer Paxton","length":"19 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"61uBSgRDXZL","asin":"B01FWOO4C8","title":"The Black Death: The World's Most Devastating Plague","authors":"Dorsey Armstrong, The Great Courses","narrators":"Dorsey Armstrong","length":"12 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51XX+sfvu0L","asin":"B00DJ6K6KG","title":"The Vikings","authors":"Kenneth W.
